# Euler
To keep my programming sharp, I've been doing some project Euler problems. This is where I'm putting my work, as well as some explanations of what I'm doing. This will mostly be in Ruby, although I may also throw in some Python and JavaScript (along with anything else I pick up.) Anyway, yeah, here it is:

- [Problem One](/p1/p1_solution.md)
- [Problem Two](p2/p2_solution.md)
- [Problem Three](p3/p3_solution.md)
- [Problem Four](p4/p4_solution.md)
